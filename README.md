# BangerShare

Brought to you by SOFTENG 750 Group 6, BangerShare is a music platform that allows users to listen to music from a variety of other platforms (e.g. Youtube, Spotify) all in one place.

## Getting Started

The application has two parts, the frontend and the server (or backend), which are in separate directories in this repository. Both parts need to be running for the application to work properly. To get everything set up, see:
